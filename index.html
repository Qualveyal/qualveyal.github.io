      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Firstly, click the flower to see something happen. It might take a bit to completely happen though. It might also make reading easier.</p>
      <p>With that out of the way, I am the GitHub user Qualve and this is my website. This website is hosted by GitHub. My plan for this website, right now, is just to store my JavaScript projects, links below. Be warned, most of these have terrible layout. These projects are placed, more or less, in the order they were made. Perhaps we'll be able to see some increase in quality as time passes, or maybe this place will be obsolete.</p>
      <p>Also, this home page will likely be updated many times. I can't say much for the other pages though.</p>
